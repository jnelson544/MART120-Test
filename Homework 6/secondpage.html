            <h1> My Short Story:</h1>
            <h2>I walked through the wildwood, and what did I see<br>
                But a unicorn with his horn stuck in a tree,<br>
                Cryin', "Someone please help me before it's too late."<br>
                I hollered, "I'll free you." He hollered back, "Wait--<br>
                How much will it hurt? How long will it take?<br>
                Are you sure that my horn will not scratch, bend, or break?<br>
                How hard will you pull? How much must I pay?<br>
                Must you do it right now or is Wednesday okay?<br>
                Have you done this before? Do you have the right tools?<br>
                Have you gradusted from horn-savin' school?<br>
                Will I owe you a favor? And what will it be?<br>
                Do you promise that you will not damage the tree?<br>
                Should I close my eyes? Should I sit down or stand?<br>
                Do you have insurance? Have you washed your hands?<br>
                And after you free me--tell me what then?<br>
                Can you guarantee I won't get stuck again?<br>
                Tell me when. Tell me how.<br>
                Tell me why. Tell me where..."<br>
                <br>
                I guess that he's still sittin' there</h2>
